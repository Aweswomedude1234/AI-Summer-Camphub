8. Design Requirements:

- The navbar must be sticky and responsive.  
- Use a clear, friendly color scheme and distinct section headers.  
- Provide a mobile-friendly grid or list layout for tools.  
- Ensure all external links open in new tabs.  
- Add smooth scrolling to anchors if applicable.

Generate the full HTML, CSS (preferably Bootstrap CDN), and any JavaScript needed so I can copy and paste the entire project into Replit as index.html or a multi-page project.

Thank you!
